        <h1>Lego Bricks</h1>
        <h2>The expensive hobby for all ages</h2>
        <h3>"Lego's have eaten my bank account for as long as i can remember"</h3>

        <p>On my 8th birthday many years back. I spent all the money I had on one lego set. It cost ruffly 130 dollars. Today I wish I had not spent that. </p>

        <h2>What about Ebay?</h2>

        <p>If you do buy Legos alot, websites like ebay and etsy can save you alot of money. You do have to be carful about being scammed, but it can be worth it.</p>
